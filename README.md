OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
project : Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. Use techniques like anomaly detection or supervised
learning with imbalanced data.

Here’s an overview of the process for building a credit card fraud detection model:


**1. Problem Overview**
Fraud detection is a binary classification problem where transactions are classified as **fraudulent** or **legitimate**. The main challenges include:
- **Highly imbalanced data**: Fraudulent transactions are a small percentage of the total.
- **Evolving patterns**: Fraud techniques change over time.


 **2. Data Preparation**
- **Dataset**: Use real-world or synthetic datasets (e.g., Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset).
- **Features**: Analyze attributes like transaction amount, location, and time.
- **Data Processing**:
  - Handle missing values, if any.
  - Scale numerical features.
  - Handle class imbalance using techniques like:
    - Oversampling (e.g., SMOTE).
    - Undersampling.
    - Cost-sensitive learning (class weights).


 **3. Model Selection**
 **Approaches**:
1. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Used when fraud labels are unavailable.
   - Techniques: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.

2. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Suitable for labeled data.
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), Neural Networks.



 **4. Model Training**
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Train the model using appropriate algorithms.
- Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robust performance.



 **5. Evaluation**
Focus on metrics suitable for imbalanced data:
 **Precision**: How many predicted frauds are actual frauds.
 **Recall**: How many actual frauds are detected.
 **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
 **ROC-AUC**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
 **PR-AUC**: Useful for imbalanced datasets.
